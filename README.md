## Approach and Implementation

**Splash Page**  

splash screen of this app  shows a welcome message and a loading indicator for 5 seconds before checking if the user is logged in. Based on their login status, it navigates them to either the home page(if user is logged in) or the login page(if user is not logged in).
I used stateful widget to change its appearence according to user interaction. 

**Login Page**  

Here,first authentication status of user is checked,if the user is not signed in,they can sign in via google login.  
After signing in,they are redirected to home page.  

**Home Page**  

This HomePage is the central hub of the chat app. It manages user authentication, provides options to access settings and a chatbot, and handles navigation and scroll events.user can also choose light or dark mode.It consists of a Scaffold with a toggleable app bar that allows switching between light and dark themes.  

**Settings Page**  

This SettingsPage code provides a user-friendly interface for managing personal settings, including uploading a profile image, entering a nickname, and sharing about oneself. It effectively utilizes Flutter's state management through the Provider package, integrates Firebase for image storage, and leverages custom constants for consistency. The structured layout ensures smooth interactions, enhancing the overall user experience in my chat application.  

**Chatting Page**  

This is the part Where I spent most of my time.The Chatpage in this  application integrates a seamless chat experience, allowing users to communicate with a chatbot. It leverages Firestore for real-time message storage and retrieval, ensuring messages are displayed promptly. The implementation of a REST API call to retrieve bot responses enhances user interaction, with built-in error handling and retry logic for robustness. Overall, this screen exemplifies effective use of state management and external APIs, delivering a dynamic chatting environment.  

you can get details of API in API Reference.  


**MAIN FUNCTION**  

The main function initializes the Flutter application with Firebase services.The MyApp class sets up a multi-provider environment, integrating authentication and settings management through the AuthProvider and SettingProvider.  

So,Basically The main function serves as the entry point for the Flutter application.The app is Well Prepared for Further Development.
